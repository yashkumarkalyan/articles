The state of Haryana is embarking on an ambitious plan to establish Jind city as its new capital, strategically located in the central part of the state. This decision comes as part of a broader vision to decentralize development and promote balanced growth across the region. Jind, with its rich historical significance and central location, is poised to become a hub of administrative, economic, and cultural activities. The new capital will feature state-of-the-art infrastructure, modern urban planning, and sustainable development practices, making it a model city for the 21st century.

A key component of this transformation is the development of an extensive metro network, which will include 55 metro stations spread across a 90-kilometer route. This metro system will not only connect Jind to other major cities in Haryana but also integrate seamlessly with existing transportation networks in the National Capital Region (NCR). The metro project aims to reduce traffic congestion, lower carbon emissions, and provide efficient, affordable public transportation for residents and commuters. With modern amenities and cutting-edge technology, the metro system will be a cornerstone of Jind's urban mobility strategy.

In addition to the metro, the state government is investing heavily in road infrastructure to support the new capital's growth. Plans include the construction of 190 kilometers of national highways and 290 kilometers of state highways, creating a robust network that will enhance connectivity across the region. These highways will facilitate the smooth movement of goods and people, boosting trade, tourism, and economic development. The improved road infrastructure will also reduce travel time between Jind and other key cities, making it an attractive destination for businesses and investors.

To further elevate Jind's status as a major urban center, the government has announced plans to build a new airport. This airport will cater to both domestic and international flights, positioning Jind as a gateway to Haryana and the surrounding regions. The airport, combined with the metro and highway networks, will create a multimodal transportation ecosystem that supports the city's rapid growth. Together, these infrastructure projects underscore the government's commitment to transforming Jind into a thriving capital city that balances modernity with sustainability, while serving as a catalyst for regional development.
